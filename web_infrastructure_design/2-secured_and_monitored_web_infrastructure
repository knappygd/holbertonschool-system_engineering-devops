The role of the firewall is to filter out network traffic in and out a machine.
HTTPS is a secute HTTP protocol, which means that if someone intercepts the traffic, it cannot be read.
Monitoring serves to check if something is broken or slow. It works by collecting data and analyzing it.
The monitoring client is configured to collect web server data and
have an alert triggered if QPS (Queries per second) gets out of control.
One downside of terminating SSL at the load balancer level is that the traffic between the load balancer
and the web servers is unencrypted.
Another drawback of having one master MySQL server accepting writes is that if it goes down, the application cannot write to it anymore.
Having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server)
might be a problem because their consumption will not grow the same way between each of them, so we might want to
have more database servers than application servers for instance.
Having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server)
might be a problem because when there is maintenance performed on a server for a specific component, it will affect other components that are on it.
